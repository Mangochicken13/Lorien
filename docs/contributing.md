# How to contribute

## General
This guide is loosly based on [Godot's contributing guidelines](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md):
- We use Godot 4.3-stable
- If you want to implement a big feature, open an issue or a [Github discussion](https://github.com/mbrlabs/Lorien/discussions) so we can talk about it first
- Format your commit messages with readability in mind

## Codestyle
- Adapt to the project's coding style
- Use C-style logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!` instead of `and`, `or`, `not`
- Use function separators (see any `.gd` file in this repository for examples)
- Always use static typing
